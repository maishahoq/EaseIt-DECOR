Description
EaseIt Decor AR application is a smartphone application, functionable on  iOS devices, that gives the user a realistic understanding of the item he or she is buying and whether it suits their space. The application is going to help users decorate their real rooms/space with items they are considering to buy online.

Installation




We haven’t yet launched our app on Google Playstore or App Store. For now, after unzipping the folder containing the application files. The user has to open the Unity 3D engine and from there open the application folder . The software will open up containing our work. For iOs devices, the user follows the following instructions from this website by Unity:

Usage ( manual) 
We request the user to refer to the following YouTube link to get an abridged version of the usage of the application EaseIt DECOR. The video will guide through every functionality of the app as shown in the above visuals:

Problems, challenges and what we would have done differently if we do it again


Several errors and challenges were faced during the development of the project. Starting from color code was not working for the separate children of the prefab furniture, example bed. We then realized that because the object was getting instantiated we had to find this instantiated gameobject. It was a bit difficult to figure out the optimal method to do so, but we arrived at giving a name to the object instantiated in the code and using that name to refer to it in the colorModifier code. 
Then, our move code was not being a swift drag, it was dragging the objects, but the drag was not smooth. So, we had to add and edit the move code from other code examples while making sure the original code does not get affected. Now, our objects get dragged smoothly without a slight jerk that happened before. 


We want to make our app an excellent one so we have proposed other features we want to develop in the future. 
NOt exactly again, but we hope to add the following features to the app soon:
1. The user will be able to  hide the object by clicking on the specific furniture button. The user can choose to reset his/her space so that all objects projected are removed by clicking on a ‘reset’ button.
2. For now, we have separate codes for the scaling, rotation and movement of specific objects. In the future, we want one code for scaling, rotation and movement respectively to work on as many objects the user decides to bring on screen. For this, we are learning Vuforia Engine and trying to improve the functionality of the app.
3. We want to add more 3D objects into the apps library
4. Options to return the object to its original position or scale or rotation may be added too. 
5. If the user wants to buy a photo canvas, he or she can select the image she wants to print on the canvas and project it onto the canvas to give him or her a visual feel of how the photo canvas would look like when printed.






Acknowledgment


We are very grateful and appreciate Professor Mohamad Eid for giving us this golden opportunity to work on this amazing project on Augmented Reality. His class sessions were very encouraging. We want to mention that all three of us are complete beginners in coding with bare previous knowledge. It was the Professor's systemic guideline and the structure course that helped us learn the topics and apply it to this project. In the beginning, we were a bit worried about the possibility and acceptance of this application we wanted to make. But Professor’s generous and encouraging comment on the First Project report gave us inspiration.  We also thank our Instructor Mohammed Hassan Jamil for the very detailed tutorials and resources provided to bring our project this far.  We are grateful to our mentor, Prince,  who helped us  a lot in finalizing this project within the limited time frame. His suggested LinkedIn Learning course on Augmented Reality, Unity: AR Visualization  gave us an in depth idea on Unity about which we were really worried in the beginning. Lastly, but absolutely not the least, Instructor Panos Economou gave us basic ideas and motivated us a lot. We are thankful and appreciate his help.
